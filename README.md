# Responsive Navigation Menu (Main & Side)
 This combines a main and side menu together. The main menu comes from another of my repositories and I added a side navigation from a tutorial/code sample. Why? I want to have the ability to use this as husk or shell or container for future websites so I don't have to keep going through the process of adding side navigations repeatedly.
